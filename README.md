3. Your new secure password is created and ready to use.

>[!NOTE]
>If you enter spaces or special characters the app will ignore them and generate a password with the characters supported (Lowercase/Uppercase letters, and Numbers).
## I don't like the password the app gave me, ¿Can i change it?
Yes! To do so you need to press the "Reset Encryption Keys" ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87c1cd9b-e05f-481f-8a42-2b53485e24db) and it will generate new encryption keys.

>[!NOTE]
>If you are already using another generated password with this set of keys you will need to either:
>Save the secure password somewhere OR Change to a password generated with the new keys in whatever accounts you used it before.
## Im changing PCs, ¿How do i get access to the same passwords i got in my previous pc?
You can import the encryption keys into the new PC.  
Press the "Export encryption keys" button ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8b527f1-cccd-4841-9d83-c63706916294) and select a folder where the keys will be exported to,

then move the exported keys into a folder in your new PC, preferably a folder that is easy to find, like in desktop for example,  
finally, on the new PC press the "Import encryption keys" button ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7cefeff-d135-4106-a382-db24361d5943) and select BOTH keys, then press import.
