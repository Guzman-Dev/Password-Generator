# Password-Generator
## ¿What is this application for?
The purpose of this application is to have easy access to a more complicated password without the need to store it anywhere.

¿Have you ever wanted to have more secure passwords but you can't remember them and don't want the saved somewhere other than your mind? With this app you can access to them from an easy to remember password!
## ¿How do i use it?
To get a safer password you will need to enter a simple password/key of your choice (only lowercase and uppercase letters and numbers) which will be converted into a more safe password to use wherever you want.

>[!NOTE]
>If you enter spaces or special characters the app will ignore them and generate a password with the characters supported (Lowercase and Uppercase letters, Numbers).
## ¿How it works?
Every time you enter a simple password the app will convert all the characters in it into a more safe password thanks to encryption keys generated on the first time you open the app.
## I don't like the password the app gave me, ¿Can i change it?
Yes! To do so you need to press the "Reset Encryption Keys" button(The spinning arrow) and it will generate new encryption keys.
>[!NOTE]
>If you are already using another generated password with this set of keys you will need to either:
>Save the safe password somewhere OR Change to a password generated with the new keys in whatever accounts you used it before.
## Im changing PC, ¿How do i get access to the same passwords i got in my previous pc?
You can copy the encryption keys from the old pc into the new one.
Press the "Export encryption keys" button(The file with an Upwards arrow) and select a folder where the keys will be exported to, then copy and replace both encryption keys into "Documents/Password Creator Keys/" on your new PC.
>[!IMPORTANT]
>To have the folder generated in your new pc you will have to open the app in the new pc atleast once.
